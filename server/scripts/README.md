# Database Scripts

This directory contains scripts for managing the database and sample data.

## Available Scripts

### Migration
```bash
bun run db:migrate
```
Runs database migrations to update the schema.

### Seeding
```bash
bun run db:seed
```
Populates the database with sample data including:
- 1 Organization (Parrocchia San Marco)
- 16 Users (1 priest + 15 parents with different roles)
- 8 Families with 1-3 members each
- 15+ Children (1-3 per family)
- Authorized persons for child pickup
- 10 Events with realistic Italian parish activities
- Event registrations linking children to events
- Family invitations

### Reset and Seed
```bash
bun run db:reset
```
Clears all existing data and runs the seed script. Useful for development when you want to start fresh.

### Other Database Operations
```bash
bun run db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio for database inspection
bun run db:drop      # Drop all tables
bun run db:push      # Push schema changes without migrations
```
